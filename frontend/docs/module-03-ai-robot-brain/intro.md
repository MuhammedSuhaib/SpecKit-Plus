# Module 3: AI Robot Brain - Perception Overview

## Introduction to Perception in AI Robotics

Perception forms the foundation of intelligent robotic behavior, enabling robots to interpret and understand their environment. In AI robotics, perception systems act as the robot's sensory apparatus, processing real-world data to make informed decisions and navigate complex scenarios.

## Key Components of Robot Perception

This module explores the critical aspects of robotic perception:

1. **Computer Vision**: Processing visual information to identify objects, understand spatial relationships, and navigate environments
2. **Sensor Integration**: Combining multiple sensor inputs to create a comprehensive understanding of the environment
3. **Depth Perception**: Understanding three-dimensional space and distances for safe navigation
4. **Real-time Processing**: Handling sensor data streams in real-time for responsive behavior

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:
- How robots process visual information using computer vision techniques
- The role of depth cameras in spatial perception
- Navigation systems that enable autonomous movement
- The integration of perception with decision-making systems

## Module Structure

This module is organized into:
- Chapter 05: Computer Vision (featuring YOLO and Depth cameras)
- Chapter 06: Navigation (covering Nav2 and SLAM)

Perception is the first step in the classic perception-action cycle, where robots must first understand their environment before executing appropriate actions.
