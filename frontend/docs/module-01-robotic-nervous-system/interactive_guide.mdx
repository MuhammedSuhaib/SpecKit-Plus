# Adding Interactive Content to Your Book

This guide shows you how to add rich, interactive content to make your Embodied Intelligence textbook more engaging.

## Available Interactive Components

### 1. Neural Network Simulator
A hands-on tool for understanding AI decision-making:

```mdx
import NeuralNetworkSimulator from '@site/src/components/NeuralNetworkSimulator';

<NeuralNetworkSimulator />
```

### 2. Knowledge Quizzes
Test understanding with interactive questions:

```mdx
import Quiz from '@site/src/components/Quiz';

<Quiz
  question="What is the main advantage of embodied AI over traditional AI?"
  options={[
    "Better learning from environment",
    "More computational power",
    "Faster processing",
    "Cheaper hardware"
  ]}
  answer={0}
  explanation="Embodied AI learns from direct interaction with the physical environment, which provides richer and more realistic training data."
/>
```

### 3. 3D Robot Viewer
Visualize different robot types and configurations:

```mdx
import Robot3DViewer from '@site/src/components/Robot3DViewer';

<Robot3DViewer />
```

### 4. Path Planning Simulator
Visualize how robots navigate around obstacles:

```mdx
import RobotPathSimulator from '@site/src/components/RobotPathSimulator';

<RobotPathSimulator />
```

## How to Add New Interactive Components

### Step 1: Create the Component
Create new components in `frontend/src/components/`:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const NewInteractiveComponent = () => {
  const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your interactive UI */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default NewInteractiveComponent;
```

### Step 2: Import and Use in MDX
```mdx
import NewInteractiveComponent from '@site/src/components/NewInteractiveComponent';

<NewInteractiveComponent />
```

## Content-Specific Interactive Ideas

### For Robotics Content:
- **Robot Control Interface** - Let readers control virtual robots
- **Sensor Data Visualizer** - Show real-time sensor readings
- **Path Planning Simulator** - Visualize navigation algorithms
- **Gait Analysis Tool** - Demonstrate different walking patterns

### For AI/ML Content:
- **Neural Network Visualizer** - Show how networks process data
- **Training Progress Tracker** - Visualize learning curves
- **Algorithm Comparisons** - Compare different approaches interactively
- **Parameter Tuning Playground** - Adjust hyperparameters and see results

### For Simulation Content:
- **Physics Simulation** - Interactive physics demonstrations
- **Environment Builder** - Create custom simulation environments
- **Behavior Designer** - Design robot behaviors and see results

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it Educational** - Every interactive element should reinforce learning objectives
2. **Make it Intuitive** - Provide clear instructions and feedback
3. **Responsive Design** - Ensure interactions work on all devices
4. **Performance** - Optimize complex interactions to avoid lag
5. **Accessibility** - Include keyboard navigation and screen reader support

# Interactive Robotics Chapter

## Introduction

This chapter uses interactive elements to help you understand robotics concepts.

## Neural Network Decision Making

Try adjusting the parameters to see how decisions change:

import NeuralNetworkSimulator from '@site/src/components/NeuralNetworkSimulator';

<NeuralNetworkSimulator />

## Test Your Understanding

import Quiz from '@site/src/components/Quiz';

<Quiz
  question="What determines a robot's movement in this simulation?"
  options={[
    "Sensor inputs and weights",
    "Random chance",
    "Pre-programmed sequence",
    "External commands"
  ]}
  answer={0}
  explanation="The robot's movement is determined by sensor inputs processed through weighted neural connections."
