# Interactive Elements Demo

## Neural Network Visualization

Try adjusting the inputs and weights in this interactive neural network simulator:

import NeuralNetworkSimulator from '@site/src/components/NeuralNetworkSimulator';

<NeuralNetworkSimulator />

## Test Your Knowledge

import Quiz from '@site/src/components/Quiz';

<Quiz
  question="What is the main advantage of embodied AI over traditional AI?"
  options={[
    "Better learning from environment",
    "More computational power",
    "Faster processing",
    "Cheaper hardware"
  ]}
  answer={0}
  explanation="Embodied AI learns from direct interaction with the physical environment, which provides richer and more realistic training data compared to simulated or abstract environments."
/>

## Robot 3D Visualization

import Robot3DViewer from '@site/src/components/Robot3DViewer';

<Robot3DViewer />

## Adding Interactive Elements to Your Chapters

You can add interactive elements to any chapter by importing and using the components:

```mdx
import NeuralNetworkSimulator from '@site/src/components/NeuralNetworkSimulator';

<NeuralNetworkSimulator />
```

## More Interactive Possibilities

Here are additional interactive elements you can create:

1. **Robot Control Simulator** - Let readers control a virtual robot
2. **AI Decision Tree Visualizer** - Show how AI makes decisions
3. **Simulation Parameters** - Allow readers to adjust simulation variables
4. **Progress Trackers** - Track learning progress through the book
5. **Interactive Glossary** - Click terms to see definitions and examples
6. **3D Model Viewers** - Rotate and examine robot designs
7. **Sensor Data Visualizers** - Real-time sensor readings visualization
8. **Path Planning Simulators** - Visualize robot navigation algorithms

## Best Practices

- Keep interactive elements focused on learning objectives
- Provide clear instructions for interaction
- Include visual feedback when users interact
- Make sure elements work on both desktop and mobile
- Add loading states for complex simulations
