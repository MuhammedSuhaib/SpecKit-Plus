## 3D Robot Viewer

import Robot3DViewer from '@site/src/components/Robot3DViewer';

<Robot3DViewer />

## Path Planning Simulator

import RobotPathSimulator from '@site/src/components/RobotPathSimulator';

<RobotPathSimulator />

## Adding These to Your Chapters

To add interactive elements to your own chapters:

1. **Import the component** at the top of your MDX file:
   ```mdx
   import NeuralNetworkSimulator from '@site/src/components/NeuralNetworkSimulator';
   ```

2. **Use the component** anywhere in your content:
   ```mdx
   <NeuralNetworkSimulator />
   ```

3. **Customize as needed** with props for specific content

These interactive elements will make your textbook much more engaging and help readers better understand complex concepts through hands-on interaction!
